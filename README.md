# Hello there! I'm Emanuele Fazzini

A passionate fullstack developer specializing in crafting web and mobile applications. I am a graduate student in master's degree computer science at Bologna University with a special interest for decentralized system.

Currently, I'm working at Net Service S.p.A. on a Java application seamlessly integrated with Docker microservices. My expertise spans from JavaFX and React for the frontend to Spring Boot for the backend, with proficiency in SQL and MongoDB databases.

I approach work with patience, a dedication to problem-solving and I try to help my colleagues with anything I can help with. I consider myself a curious person and excited to explore emerging technologies.

Looking ahead, I aim to expand my skills as a fullstack developer and aspire to more advanced roles by increasing my expertise.

### [Predictive analysis for anomaly detection on bridges infrastructures](https://gitlab.com/BonnyBay/bridges-sensors)

- We present a study where the aim is to find anomalies with a data-driven approach, using supervised techniques such as Neural Networks (feed-forward), SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN and Random Forest. We developed binary and multiclass classification.

### [Fatball.io](https://gitlab.com/BonnyBay/fatball)

- Game based on Colyseus framework to build a multiplayer game in distributed manner using Redis Presence for scalability. The project consists in a realtime game which every player needs to shot enemies, eats balls and became the fat one.

### [NoiSense - Crowdsensing platform for monitoring the noise in the world](https://gitlab.com/ema.fazz/context-aware-system)

- This project is divided in two main platform:

    - A website where it is possible to see the measurements done by the users on a map;

    - An Android application with which users take noise measuraments and send them to the server to store them into the database.
