# Hello there! I'm Emanuele Fazzini

A passionate fullstack developer specializing in crafting web and mobile applications. I am a graduate student in master's degree computer science at Bologna University with a special interest for decentralized system.

Currently, I'm working at Net Service S.p.A. on a Java application seamlessly integrated with Docker microservices. My expertise spans from JavaFX and React for the frontend to Spring Boot for the backend, with proficiency in SQL and MongoDB databases.

I approach work with patience, a dedication to problem-solving and I try to help my colleagues with anything I can help with. I consider myself a curious person and excited to explore emerging technologies.

Looking ahead, I aim to expand my skills as a fullstack developer and aspire to more advanced roles by increasing my expertise. For more details, please download my resume from the menu above.
